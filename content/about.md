I'm the guy who makes computers work together to solve problems in a smart way. 
Currently doing that as a *Senior Staff Software Engineer* @ *[Cision](https://www.cision.com/)*. 
Before that, I went through founding-till-exit journey with:
- [Factmata](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/factmata) (A *Machine Learning* startup fighting *misinformation, disinformation and fake news*. Acquired By [Cision](https://cision.com))
- [Arqam](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/arqamfc) (The top *football data analytics* startup. Acquired By [Statsbomb](https://www.statsbomb.com/) which recently did an exit)

I'm also a part-time MBA student at *[Edinburgh Business School](https://www.hw.ac.uk/ebs/)*. Where I'm specialized in Bussiness Economics and Strategy.
