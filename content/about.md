Iâ€™m a Software Engineer who happens to love what he do. For most of my career I've been at the right place at the right time. I'm known for being a big fan for Python, Go and distributed systems. I'm also known for being a big nerd who can't say no to a challenging problem.

For the past decade I've been working on making software faster and more efficient. I work mainly on Data, ML Systems and Distributed Systems. Currently I'm a Senior Staff Engineer @ [Cision](https://www.cision.com/). Before that, I worked for a couple of exited startups [Factmata](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/factmata) (Acquired By [Cision](https://cision.com)) & [Arqam](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/arqamfc) (Acquired By [Statsbomb](https://www.statsbomb.com/)) and some failed ones.
