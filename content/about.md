Iâ€™m a Software Engineer who happens to love what he do. For most of my career I've been at the right places at the right time. I'm known for being a big fan for Python, Go and data and distributed.

For the last **decade**, I've been working on making software faster and more efficient. I work on Data, ML Systems and Distributed Systems. 
Currently I'm a *Senior Staff Software Engineer* @ *[Cision](https://www.cision.com/)*. Before that, I woked for a couple of exited startups:
- [Factmata](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/factmata) (A *Machine Learning* startup fighting *misinformation, disinformation and fake news*. Acquired By [Cision](https://cision.com))
- [Arqam](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/arqamfc) (The top *football data analytics* startup. Acquired By [Statsbomb](https://www.statsbomb.com/)) and some failed ones.

I'm also a part-time masters student at *[Edinburgh Business School](https://www.hw.ac.uk/ebs/)*. Where I'm studying MBA specialized in Bussiness Economics and Strategy.
