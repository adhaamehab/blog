* Disclaimer: I try to keep this list updated, but I sometime forget to do so. 
* Some of those books I didn't get to finish (specifically that I started when working on a new project) But those are still the ones that I bought and would defer to at any time.
* I ommited a lot of books that I read but I wouldn't necessarily recommend.
